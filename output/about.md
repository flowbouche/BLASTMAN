## BLASTMAN Model
### Output directory

The output directory is where you will find all of the results from model simulations, including the numbers and percentages of trees infected and killed by black stain root disease (BSRD). Each file name begins with a unique run ID beginning with 'r' (e.g., r38426_...) that also indicates some of the model settings.

The output directory also contains a sub-directory called 'rasters' where raster files will be output if such outputs are produced (depending on the user's settings).
