# BLASTMAN
The BLack STain root disease landscape forest MANagement model (BLASTMAN) is an agent-based model implemented in NetLogo, R, and Go that simulates forest management disturbances (i.e., thinnings and clear-cut regeneration harvests) and the spread of a tree disease in forested landscapes.

Adam J. Bouch√© developed this model under the guidance of Dr. Klaus J. Puettmann and Dr. David C. Shaw as a thesis for a Master of Science (MS) degree in Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University between 2017 and 2020.

This model also relies on a program developed by Mario Vega located at https://github.com/mariowhowrites/spread-infection.

## HOW TO INSTALL THE MODEL
Within the model directory, several other directories are required.
