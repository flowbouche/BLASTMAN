# BLASTMAN
The BLack STain root disease landscape forest MANagement model (BLASTMAN) is an agent-based model implemented in NetLogo, R, and Go that simulates forest management disturbances (i.e., thinnings and clear-cut regeneration harvests) and the spread of a tree disease in forested landscapes.
