# BLASTMAN
The BLack STain root disease landscape forest MANagement model (BLASTMAN) is an agent-based model implemented in NetLogo, R, and Go that simulates forest management disturbances (i.e., thinnings and clear-cut regeneration harvests) and the spread of a tree disease in forested landscapes.

Adam J. Bouch√© developed this model under the guidance of Dr. Klaus J. Puettmann and Dr. David C. Shaw as a thesis for a Master of Science (MS) degree in Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University between 2017 and 2020.

This model also relies on a program developed by Mario Vega located at https://github.com/mariowhowrites/spread-infection.

## USING THE MODEL ON YOUR COMPUTER
Several directories must be located in the same directory as the model ('.nlogo'):

#### /supporting_files
A directory containing all of the '.nls' files used by the main model file, including:
  **basic_functions_1.10.0.0.nls
  insect-attraction_1.10.0.0.nls
  probability_parameters_1.10.0.0.nls
  ring_lists_1.10.0.0.nls
  spread-infection_Go_1.10.0.0.nls**
